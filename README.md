## About

Scout is FRC team 6153's interpretation of scouting. Scout is comprised of two parts; The app, and the server. This repository contains all of the app code. The app is completely cross-platform and is prgrammed using web technologies. For it's primary framework, it uses Ionic 3.

### Tools

- Visual Studio Code (Or Any Good Text Editor)
- Node.js (Can be Installed Through Brew on Macs)
- Ionic (Installed from NPM)

### Editing

For those new to Ionic, you should only edit the **src/** directory (for the most part). While editing, please follow the guidelines outlined for our team [here](https://github.com/BlueCrewRobotics/Guidelines-and-Resources/wiki "Code Guidelines"). This is one of those situations where you should do as I say, not as I do. The code in this repository is messy and licking comments. It's some code that I threw together in one weekend.
